- 7daystodie Version: 1.0 (b333)
- Install with [Vortex](https://www.nexusmods.com/about/vortex/).

## v1.0.1 09-Aug-24
- fix: loading_image wasn't properly hidden leading to XML errors; although it hadn't any negative user impact.
## v1.0.0 09-Aug-24
- Hides tips; silenced click sound, mouse icons, and spawn header panel.
- Replaces the main loading screen with the main image, logo removed, vignette, vintaged.
- Changes & translates:
    - 'Spawn' button to 'Open Your Eyes'
    - 'Building environment...' button to "You're awake"
- First loading screen message: 'In a world gone silent only the strong endure.'
- Translates to all languages in game.

## Backlog
- Instead of hiding the loading messages of second loading screen, replace them with additional immersive messages. Similar to what was done with the first loading screen.
 
## Development
- Use Google Sheet to edit the Localization.txt
